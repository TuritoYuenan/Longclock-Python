# Longitude Time

This is a clock app that tells time based on the user's longitude

## Concept

- Time zones were originally determined by longitude (and they still do!).
- But if you look at a time zone map, you'll notice most time zone boundaries got bent around country borders, or just pierced through completely.
- This is because many countries choose to observe one or a few time zones for uniformity and simplicity.
- It's fine, but it also means time in many places are not as correct as we thought (not even to mention DST).
- **Longitude Time** as an app provides an insight on what each location's realtime is.
